{"name":"QuodJS","tagline":"Object-Oriented JavaScript","body":"# QuodJS - Object Oriented JavaScript\r\n\r\nA small library to add basic OO features to JavaScript.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nv0.0.1\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nAn annotated version of the code is available in `src/annotated`,\r\nand the generated documentation (made with [Docco] (http://jashkenas.github.io/docco/))\r\ncan be found in `docs/quod.html` (and also [here] (docs/quod.html)).\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\nTo use QuodJS just include `src/quod.min.js` in your HTML file.\r\n\r\n## Node.js\r\n\r\nQuodJS is tested and working with Node.js v0.11.13.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n`testset.js` contains a few examples of what you can achieve with QuodJS.\r\nYou can see it running at `tests/index.html`.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n### v0.0.1\r\n\r\nInitial public release.\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\n\r\nThis project is just \"for fun\", some kind of syntactic sugar added to the language\r\nI use (and actually like) the most. I'm sure there are plenty of ways to achieve the same\r\nresults with better performances, or a cleaner code, I just haven't found them yet.\r\nIf you care to contribute, be my guest ^_^\r\n\r\nAlso, this project is in a really early stage and can change in the most unpredictable way at any time. If you want to get all the future updates, remember to [watch](https://github.com/goffreder/QuodJS/subscription) this project.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nReleased under the MIT License.

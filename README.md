can be found in `docs/quod.html`.

## Install

To use QuodJS just include `src/quod.min.js` in your HTML file.

## Node.js

QuodJS is tested and working with Node.js v0.11.13.

`testset.js` contains a few examples of what you can achieve with QuodJS.
You can see it running at `tests/index.html`.

## Changelog

### v0.0.1

Initial public release.

## Disclaimer

This project is just "for fun", some kind of syntactic sugar added to the language
I use (and actually like) the most. I'm sure there are plenty of ways to achieve the same
results with better performances, or a cleaner code, I just haven't found them yet.
If you care to contribute, be my guest ^_^
